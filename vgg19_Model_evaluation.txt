MODEL - VGG19

## Test the accuracy of the generated model on the validation or test set.
Validation-set classification accuracy: 97.24%
Validation-set classification loss: 9.25%

MODEL EVALUATION

## One particular image of the COVID patient prediction gave about 99% accuracy. Tried this on random for 5 samples like this and got accuracy between 97 - 99%.

## plot_covid_score.png
The y - axis of this plot is in log scale ( is feasible as we have a good classification accuracy).
The yellow lines very close to 1 are the images that have a very good classification and represent the covid score.
On the other hand the blue lines are close to zero and represent (1-covid score)= other images (pneumonia or normal images score)

## For the covid score above we now compute the accuracy
# We see that the predicted labels are quite similar to the true ones as the model accuracy is pretty good for the model.
predicted labels:
[[0. 1. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0.]
 ...
 [1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 1. 0.]]
true labels:
[[0. 0. 1.]
 [1. 0. 0.]
 [1. 0. 0.]
 ...
 [1. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1.]
 [0. 0. 1.]]

## At threshold of 0.3 we get overall accuracy of model as 91% approx. for both train and validation sets which means due ot the images quality there is overall reduction in actual prediction of model compared to single images.

# Train - 
all  219 misclassified samples (91.64%)

# Validation dataset - 
all   29 misclassified samples (90.00%)


CONCLUSION
On viewing some Xray images (code and image included in VGG main folder), we observe that the images are not very well taken and hence there is a chance of misclassification. Nevertheless this is a start point to train deep neural networks for a long term future direction with more images available and better classification approaches than the one discussed here.
Misclassified images_color bad.png - this is the images that have very bad colors and are hence unclear. This is due to the image preprocessing performed by the dataset iterator.
